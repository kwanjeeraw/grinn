Description: Grinn is a bioinformatics platform contains an internal graph
    database (Neo4j), and the R package for omics studies. The package allows
    reconstruction of different network types e.g. metabolite-protein-gene,
    metabolite-protein, metabolite-pathway, protein-gene, protein-pathway and gene-
    pathway. grinn incorporates data from several databases including KEGG, SMPDB,
    HMDB, REACTOME and CheBI. It uses the correlation-based network analysis to
    estimate relationships among different omics levels independently from domain
    knowledge, and with the internal graph database it allows fast integration of
    domain knowledge to annotate unknown metabolites.
